Hello, I'm Jeremy Morales.
I'd use quiet, observant, and calm to describe myself.

My favorite animals would be my pugs. I have two of them, Delilah and Samson. We rescued Delilah from her original owners when she was 4, but they weren't prepared to give up Sam yet. A couple years later they called us and asked if we would take Sam too, which we were happy to do. They're 9 now and are so full of personality they make me laugh every day.

This is only a test
